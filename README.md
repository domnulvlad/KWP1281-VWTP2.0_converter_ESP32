# KWP1281 to VWTP2.0 Converter

This project allows a K-Line KWP1281 module's measuring blocks (live data) and fault codes to be read over CAN-Bus using the Volkswagen TP2.0 protocol (KWP2000).

More details can be found in the block comment at the top of the .ino file.

It has been tested on an ESP32-C6 board, using a CAN transceiver and a K-Line transceiver.
